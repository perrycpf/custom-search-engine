Custom Search Engine was built by using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4, JavaScript, jQuery, JSON, Giphy API, OMDb API, New York Times API.

This is a responsive web application that supports different screen sizes and resolutions.

User can enter the value from the input box and adds it into topics search buttons for searching the gifs, movies and news.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

Double click a topics search button will remove the corresponding button and its local storage.

Click the trash bin button will erase all topics search buttons and local storage.
